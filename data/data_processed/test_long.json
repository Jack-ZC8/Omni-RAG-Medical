    "gold": "Noonan's syndrome is an eponymic designation that has been used during the last 8 years to describe a variable constellation of somatic and visceral congenital anomalies, which includes groups of patients previously referred to as male Turner's, female pseudo-Turner's and\n\t\t\t\t\tBonnevie-Ullrich syndromes. It is now recognized that both sexes may show the stigmas of this condition and, unlike Turner's syndrome, there is no karyotype abnormality although there is often a familial pattern. The most commonly observed anomalies include webbing of the neck, hypertelorism, a\n\t\t\t\t\tshield-shaped chest and short stature. Congenital heart disease, principally pulmonary stenosis, and sexual infantilism often with cryptorchidism in the male subject are additional associated anomalies in this syndrome. Renal anomalies have been described rarely and usually consist of\n\t\t\t\t\trotational errors, duplications and hydronephrosis. We report the first case of an infant who displayed many of the stigmas of Noonan's syndrome and also showed early evidence of frank renal failure secondary to renal dysplasia with cystic disease.",

    "gold": "Giant cell arteritis can be difficult to diagnose because its early symptoms resemble those of many common conditions. For this reason, your doctor will try to rule out other possible causes of your problem.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTo help diagnose giant cell arteritis, you may have some or all of the following tests and procedures:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPhysical exam. In addition to asking about your symptoms and medical history, your doctor is likely to perform a thorough physical exam, paying particular attention to your temporal arteries. Often, one or both of these arteries are tender with a reduced pulse and a hard, cord-like feel and appearance.\n\t\t\t\t\tBlood tests. If your doctor thinks you might have giant cell arteritis, you're likely to have a blood test that checks your erythrocyte sedimentation rate - commonly referred to as the sed rate. This test measures how quickly red blood cells fall to the bottom of a tube of blood. Red cells that\n\t\t\t\t\tdrop rapidly may indicate inflammation in your body.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou may also have a test that measures C-reactive protein (CRP), a substance your liver produces when inflammation is present. The same tests may be used to follow your progress during treatment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBiopsy. The best way to confirm a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is by taking a small sample (biopsy) of the temporal artery. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis during local anesthesia, usually with little discomfort or scarring. The sample is examined under a microscope in a\n\t\t\t\t\tlaboratory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you have giant cell arteritis, the artery will often show inflammation that includes abnormally large cells, called giant cells, which give the disease its name. It's possible to have giant cell arteritis and still have a negative biopsy result. If the results aren't clear, your doctor may\n\t\t\t\t\tadvise another temporal artery biopsy on the other side of your head.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tImaging tests may be used for diagnosing giant cell arteritis and for monitoring your response to treatment. Possible tests include:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This test combines the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of a contrast material that produces detailed images of your blood vessels. Let your doctor know ahead of time if you're uncomfortable being confined in a small space because the test is\n\t\t\t\t\tconducted in a tube-shaped machine.\n\t\t\t\t\tDoppler ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to produce images of blood flowing through your blood vessels.\n\t\t\t\t\tPositron emission tomography (PET). Using an intravenous tracer solution that contains a tiny amount of radioactive material, a PET scan can produce detailed images of your blood vessels and highlight areas of inflammation.",

This unusual growth pattern, which is known as\n\t\t\t\t\themihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as\n\t\t\t\t\ta soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking.

But it can also occur in otherwise healthy individuals who experience asthma symptoms only when they exercise.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSymptoms of Exercise-Induced Asthma\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you have EIB, you may have problems breathing within five to 20 minutes after exercise. Symptoms of EIB are similar to those of chronic asthma, but the timing of the symptoms is closely linked with physical activity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYour symptoms may include:\n\t\t\t\t\t* Wheezing\n\t\t\t\t\t* Tight chest\n\t\t\t\t\t* Cough\n\t\t\t\t\t* Shortness of breath\n\t\t\t\t\t* Chest pain (rarely)\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTriggers\n\t\t\t\t\tPeople with EIB are typically very sensitive to both low temperatures and dry air. Air is usually warmed and humidified by the nose, but during demanding activity people breathe more through their mouths. This allows cold, dry air to reach your lower airways and your lungs without passing through\n\t\t\t\t\tyour nose, triggering asthma symptoms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAir pollutants, high pollen levels and viral respiratory infections may also be triggers. Other causes of symptoms while exercising include being out of shape, poorly controlled nasal allergies or vocal cord issues.\n\t\t\t\t\tEven the sport you choose can affect your symptoms. Swimming is considered less likely to cause asthma symptoms because the warm, humid environment of the pool does not aggravate the airways. Warm-weather activities and those requiring only short bursts of energy are also recommended.

Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Infections are in many cases mild, with most people making a full recovery and remaining immune from further\n\t\t\t\t\tHAV infections. However, HAV infections can also be severe and life threatening. Most people in areas of the world with poor sanitation have been infected with this virus. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated\n\t\t\t\t\tblood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible, but is\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch less common. There is no vaccine for HCV.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV.

The prognosis largely depends on whether there is severe autoimmune disease; whether there are recurrent infections that cause structural lung damage; and the development of a\n\t\t\t\t\tmalignancy (cancer). Other major factors that influence prognosis include the extent of organ damage and how successfully infections can be prevented.\n\t\t\t\t\tAffected people who have only bacterial infections have a better prognosis than those with additional complications and can have nearly normal life expectancy. This is especially the case if they are diagnosed early and begin treatment soon after the onset of symptoms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2. In some cases, abnormal growth of small nodules of lymphoid tissue in the gastrointestinal tract (nodular lymphoid hyperplasia) may occur. In addition, an increased percent of individuals with CVID are more prone to developing certain forms of cancer than the general population such as\n\t\t\t\t\tmalignancies of lymphatic tissue (lymphoma) and possibly stomach cancer). The risk of gastric carcinoma is almost 50 times greater in patients with CVID than in other individuals.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn addition, some individuals with CVID may develop granular, inflammatory nodules (noncaseating granulomas) within tissue of the skin, lungs, spleen, and/or liver.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Of the 411 subjects with known follow-up (87% of the cohort), 93 patients (19.6%) had died.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe median age at death was 44 years for females (range 10-90 years) and 42 years for\n\t\t\t\t\tmales (range 9-79 years), not significantly different. The predominant causes of death\n\t\t\t\t\tincluded respiratory failure from chronic lung disease, lymphoid or other malignancy, or\n\t\t\t\t\toverwhelming infections (TABLE 6).

    "question": "What are the different types of diabetes and how do they affect the body?",
    "gold": "Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common\n\t\t\t\t\ttype, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting\n\t\t\t\t\ttype 2 diabetes. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes.",

The milder forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, including type I, are characterized by bone fractures during childhood and adolescence that often result from minor trauma. Fractures occur less frequently in adulthood. People with mild forms of the condition typically have a blue or grey tint to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe part of the eye that is usually white (the sclera), and may develop hearing loss in adulthood. Affected individuals are usually of normal or near normal height.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOther types of osteogenesis imperfecta are more severe, causing frequent bone fractures that may begin before birth and result from little or no trauma.

    "gold": "1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia\n\t\t\t\t\tassociated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and\n\t\t\t\t\tsperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome\n\t\t\t\t\tarchitecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous\n\t\t\t\t\trecombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.",

The defining characteristics of syncope include rapid onset with transient loss of consciousness usually accompanied by falling, followed by spontaneous, complete, and usually prompt recovery without intervention. Because some patients use the term dizziness to describe syncopal\n\t\t\t\t\tevents, it is important to ask patients exactly what they mean by dizziness and whether loss of consciousness occurred.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSyncope must be differentiated from vertigo, coma, drop attacks, dizziness, sudden cardiac death, and seizures. Vertigo (i.e., sensation of movement) does not include loss of consciousness. Coma involves loss of consciousness without spontaneous recovery. Drop attacks involve sudden falls without loss\n\t\t\t\t\tof consciousness or warning and with immediate recovery. Drop attacks may be idiopathic but also have several specific causes (e.g., underlying cardiovascular disease, spondylotic osteophytes or colloidal cysts that transiently block the vertebral arteries or cerebral aqueduct, vertebrobasilar\n\t\t\t\t\tstroke). The typical signs of epileptic seizures include dejavu, tongue lacerations, limb jerking, and postictal confusion but not common signs of syncope, such as prodromal diaphoresis, palpitations, or provocation by prolonged sitting or standing. Although limb jerking is noted in 15 percent\n\t\t\t\t\tof syncopal patients, the other typical signs of seizures are absent.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Correct and early diagnosis of TIA versus mimics is critical because early interventions (e.g., antiplatelet agents, statin therapy, blood pressure-lowering therapy, anticoagulation when appropriate) can lead to an 80 percent reduction in risk of recurrent ischemic events. The most common TIA\n\t\t\t\t\tmimics are seizures, migraines, metabolic disturbances, and syncope.

    "gold": "Fluoroquinolones, including Moxifloxacin Tablets, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2)] . This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur within hours or days of starting moxifloxacin or as long as several months after completion of therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.\n\nThe risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue Moxifloxacin Tablets immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including Moxifloxacin Tablets, in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or who have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture [see Adverse Reactions",

Long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves survival in COPD with chronic hypoxaemia. Oral steroid medication has been associated with improved survival in men and increased mortality in women, while inhaled steroid medication has been associated with a reduction in the exacerbation rate. We have analysed the relationships between pharmacological therapy including oxygen therapy, sex, performance status and need for hospitalization and mortality in 403 patients with COPD (201 men) after their registration in a national oxygen register for LTOT. The mean value of days spent in hospital per year was 44. An increased need of hospital care was independently predicted by a poor performance status, high age and, in women, orally administered steroid medication. Hospital admissions were significantly longer in the terminal stage of COPD among women receiving oral steroid medication. Increased mortality was predicted by a poor performance status and, in women, oral steroid treatment. Predictors of morbidity and mortality during LTOT were found to coincide. The increased mortality in women receiving oral steroid medication was found to be associated with an increased need of hospital care due to longer hospital stays during the terminal stage of the disease.

    "gold": "To determine which artery is blocked in an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) using an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), clinicians analyze the ECG changes to infer the localization of myocardial infarction and ischemia, which subsequently helps identify the occluded coronary artery, also referred to as the culprit [3].\nBy examining the changes in the ECG leads, doctors can pinpoint the affected area and, therefore, the corresponding coronary artery.\n The coronary artery system includes the left main coronary artery (LMCA), the left anterior descending artery (LAD), the left circumflex artery (LCX), and the right coronary artery (RCA) [3].\nEach of these arteries has multiple segments responsible for different areas of the heart [3].\nBased on specific ECG changes related to each segment, clinicians can determine the damaged area of the heart and the blocked artery associated with the AMI.\n Acute coronary syndrome, which encompasses conditions involving ischemia or infarction such as unstable angina, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, and ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), can be detected using an ECG [4].\nDuring an acute blockage, changes to the ST segment can be seen, and the presence of Q waves can indicate a previous heart attack [2].\n However, diagnosing an AMI using an ECG can be challenging as it may be difficult to differentiate between new and old changes in the ECG, important to learn how the changes in the ST segment present during an AIM\nFor the purpose of determining the blocked artery in an AMI, it is assumed that all changes in the ECG are new and representative of the ongoing infarction [4].",

Should the dose of carbamazepine be increased to try and control the pain, or should she be prescribed a different medication for pain control?",
    "gold": "In the case of a 65-year-old woman with acute paresthesic pain in her left temple and cheek, suggestive of trigeminal neuralgia, and a personal history of epilepsy managed with carbamazepine, it is reasonable to consider increasing the dose of carbamazepine for pain control under the guidance of a healthcare professional [1].\nCarbamazepine is an anticonvulsant drug that is also used as a first-line treatment for trigeminal neuralgia, due to its effectiveness in reducing nerve pain [1].\nHowever, the decision to increase the dose of carbamazepine must take into account the patient's overall health, potential side effects, and possible drug-drug interactions [1].\nIf increasing the dose of carbamazepine is not appropriate or does not provide sufficient pain relief, other medications could be considered, such as oxcarbazepine, an anticonvulsant with a similar mechanism of action to carbamazepine, or other non-anticonvulsant medications like baclofen or tricyclic antidepressants [1].",

However, it does provide some insights related to certain factors that contribute to the effectiveness of such approaches.\n\nCommunity-managed forests can integrate biodiversity conservation with local people's needs, but positive outcomes across all dimensions are rare [2]. Factors such as environmental conditions, effective tenure rights, national context, user-group characteristics, and intervention types are key predictors of joint positive outcomes [2]. In order to be more effective, a shift in biocultural conservation for sustainability is needed, moving the focus from describing how nature and culture are co-produced to co-producing knowledge for sustainability solutions [2]. This shift should also consider questions of power, gender, and transformations that have been largely neglected thus far [2].\n\nThe SDGs, such as SDG 15, are devoted to protecting terrestrial ecosystems, managing forests sustainably, combating desertification, and halting biodiversity loss, which are seen as critical foundations for sustainable development and human well-being [3]. In order to achieve these targets, diverse environmental, economic, societal, and political actions have been suggested, many of which relate to area-based conservation, including promoting sustainable resource management, agriculture, and fishery, implementing hunting and fishing quotas, and applying multifunctional spatial planning [5].

    "gold": "Automation in laboratories plays a significant role in the initial evaluation and potential detection of abnormalities like malignantl cells, as well as in the preparation of cytotechnological processes [1].\nAutomation helps in initial and secondary evaluations of specimens to determine whether they are normal, atypical, or malignant.\nAbnormal specimens, when detected, are typically referred to a pathologist for further medical diagnosis [1].\nIn terms of disease and disorder diagnosis, automated technologies provide real-time interaction with brain function processes, contributing to improved diagnosis and treatment development [2][3].\nIn the context of autoimmune disease diagnoses, technological advancements and automation have driven market growth, although the slow turnaround time of diagnosis and high frequency of false positives remain challenges [5].\nIn an automated laboratory, coupling organization principles with IT solutions could provide value in disease diagnosis, treatment, and patient monitoring [4].\nThus, automation in labs supports initial diagnosis, process efficiencies and could contribute to improved treatments but also needs to be handled with caution due to potential for false positives [1][2][3][4][5].",

    "gold": "Switching elderly patients to a drug classified by STOPP (Screening Tool of Older Persons' potentially inappropriate Prescriptions) criteria may have a significant impact on their health outcomes, as the STOPP criteria identify potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) for older adults [1].\nThe use of STOPP criteria may result in improved prescribing quality, reduced adverse drug events, and improved clinical outcomes for elderly patients [2].\nHowever, the impact of switching elderly patients to a STOPP-classified drug would potentially depend on factors such as the patient's specific health condition, medical history and the availability of alternative treatments [3].\nImplementing the STOPP criteria often involves a comprehensive medication review by healthcare professionals, aiming to carefully assess the patient's individual needs and potential risks [4].\nIn some cases, the application of STOPP criteria has been reported to reduce hospital admissions, length of hospital stay, and healthcare costs for elderly patients .\nA study conducted in Ireland showed that 34.6% of elderly patients had prescriptions classified as PIMs according to STOPP criteria, and the intervention group experienced a significant reduction in adverse drug events when PIMs were identified and altered under STOPP guidance [5].\nIn another study conducted in Spain, a significant reduction in PIMs and improved medication appropriateness was observed after applying STOPP criteria, with a potential annual cost savings of up to €9,507 per 100 patients [6].\nHowever, it is crucial to consider the individual patient's situation and weigh the potential benefits and harms of switching to an alternative medication in each case[7].\nHealthcare professionals should be cautious about making changes based solely on a list of criteria, and should incorporate evidence-based practice and clinical judgment when implementing STOPP criteria in the care of their elderly patients [8].",

    "gold": "When approaching a request to prescribe valproate in women of child bearing age, it is crucial to consider the significant... Published guidelines by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, as well as various Royal Colleges and other UK healthcare bodies, suggest valproate should not be prescribed to women of this group unless there is no other effective treatment available due to its associated risks[1][2][3].\n\nValproate (Epilim, Depakote and other generic brands) is associated with a significant risk of birth defects and developmental disorders in children born to women who take valproate during pregnancy.\n\nValproate is a treatment for epilepsy and bipolar disorder and is prescribed to thousands of women. Since its introduction in 1974, the product information for doctors has included a warning about the possible risk of birth defects. As the risks to unborn children have been increasingly understood, the warnings have been strengthened.\nIn women who take valproate while pregnant, around 1 in 10 babies will have a birth defect.\nValproate must not be used in any woman or girl able to have children unless there is a pregnancy prevention programme (PPP) in place. This is designed to make sure patients are fully aware of the risks and the need to avoid becoming pregnant.\nIf valproate is taken during pregnancy, up to 4 in 10 babies are at risk of developmental disorders, and approximately 1 in 10 are at risk of birth defects.\nWomen of reproductive age who are using valproate are advised to use highly effective contraception to avoid pregnancy. Women should be made aware that no method of contraception is 100% effective.\nMethods of contraception which are considered ‘highly effective’ include the long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods: copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD), levonorgestrel 13.5mg/19.5mg/52mg intrauterine system and progestogen-only implant (IMP), as well as male and female sterilisation (with male sterilisation, the possibility of a new partner needs to be kept in mind). These methods all have a failure rate of less than \n1% with typical use. Women using the progestogen-only implant should \navoid use of any medication that induces hepatic enzyme activity as this could reduce contraceptive effectiveness\n\nHealthcare professionals who seek to prescribe valproate to their female patients must make sure they are enrolled in the PPP. This includes the completion of a signed risk acknowledgement form when their treatment is reviewed by a specialist, at least annually.\n\nAn updated Annual Risk Acknowledgement Form is available to support the Valproate Pregnancy Prevention Programme\nGeneral practitioners’ role\n• Ensure continuous use of highly effective contraception in all women of childbearing \npotential (consider the need for pregnancy testing if not a highly effective method).\n• Check that all patients have an up to date, signed, Annual Risk Acknowledgment Form \n(ARAF) each time a repeat prescription is issued.\n• Ensure the patient is referred back to the specialist for annual review.\n• Refer to the specialist urgently (within days) in case of unplanned pregnancy or where a \npatient wants to plan a pregnancy\nA regional Irish mental health service study pointed out that there is a deficiency in the level of awareness and documentation of the teratogenic effects of valproate among women of child-bearing potential[5], this serves as a call for healthcare providers to be thorough and clear while discussing treatment plans involving Valproate for women in this group.\nA letter has been sent by NHS England to  to women and girls aged 12-55 who are currently prescribed sodium valproate and contains important reminders of safety considerations, including around contraception, pregnancy and regular prescribing reviews.\n  In essence, valproate should be administered to girls and women of childbearing age as a last resort treatment, ensuring the potential risks are well-communicated, effective contraceptive measures are employed, and the overall health status closely monitored[1][2][3].\n\nWomen of childbearing potential, whatever their underlying diagnosis, should  not be prescribed valproate unless there are exceptional circumstances. During pregnancy, the MHRA regulations also state that valproate should not be prescribed except in rare situations in epilepsy for patients who are resistant or intolerant to other treatments.",

    "gold": "As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or experiences[1].\nHowever, I can provide information on the topic of spontaneous regeneration of axons in the peripheral nervous system[2].\nSpontaneous regeneration of axons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is a well-documented and studied phenomenon [3].\nThe regenerative capacity of the PNS is significantly greater than that of the central nervous system (CNS) due to differences in the intrinsic regenerative ability of neurons and the extracellular environment [4].\nFollowing peripheral nerve injury, axons in the PNS can naturally regenerate and reestablish connections to their targets, albeit with varying degrees of success [5].\nThis regenerative capacity can be attributed to multiple factors, including changes in the injured neurons' gene expression program, activation of supporting Schwann cells, and the presence of growth factors and other molecules that promote axonal growth [6].\nSchwann cells play a particularly critical role in peripheral nerve regeneration, as they guide axonal regrowth, release neurotrophic factors, and modulate the immune response at the site of injury [7].\nWhile spontaneous regeneration of axons in the PNS is a promising aspect of the body's natural healing process, it is important to note that the functional recovery of damaged nerves is often incomplete, resulting in some degree of permanent motor and sensory deficits [8].\nMoreover, the rate of regeneration can be slow, sometimes taking months or years to restore even partial function [9].\nTo improve functional recovery, research is ongoing to develop therapeutic strategies that can boost the regenerative capacity of the PNS, such as enhancing the activation and function of Schwann cells, modulating the inflammatory response, and promoting axonal growth through the delivery of growth factors [10].\nAdditionally, surgical techniques, such as nerve grafting and nerve transfer, can be employed to achieve better functional outcomes in cases where spontaneous regeneration is insufficient [11].\nIn conclusion, spontaneous regeneration of axons in the peripheral nervous system demonstrates the PNS's inherent potential for repair and recovery following injury[12].\nHowever, the regenerative process is often slow and incomplete, highlighting the need for ongoing research and development of therapies to enhance the body's natural healing mechanisms[13].",

    "gold": "The treatment for a patient with burns over 25% of his body surface could be quite complex and would depend on the severity and degree of the burns.\nHowever, based on the context provided, it is clear that such a patient would require fluid resuscitation, which should be calculated using the time of burn, patient's body mass, and the surface of burn, for example, by using the Parkland formula [2].\nMonitoring of urinary output can be useful to determine the adequacy of fluid replacement [2].\nSome patients may require a nasogastric tube [2].\n  Administering analgesia is also an important aspect of burn care to manage the pain [2].\nIf the burns are second or third degree, the patient might be a candidate for operative treatment such as a tangential skin graft which involves the removal of dead skin and replacement with healthy skin [3].\nDeeper burns (third degree and fourth degree) damage or destroy the epidermis and dermis, making the patient feel numb and even extend the damage to muscle and bones [4].\n  Moreover, since the patient has burns of varying degrees all over his body and more than 25% of his body surface [5], they will be classified as having critical or major burns [5].\nThe danger of infection is high for such serious burn victims, and infection is the top cause of death among them, thus, infection control measures will also be a key component of the patient's treatment plan [5].\n  Aside from these, the patient may also have psychological effects due to the burns and thus, therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy, facilitated by virtual reality, may be considered to help the patient process and manage their experience and emotions [1].",

    "gold": "In a postmenopausal patient with breast cancer lacking hormone receptors and with liver damage due to chemotherapy, the treatment options would mainly include targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and supportive care  [1].\nTargeted therapies, such as PARP inhibitors or CDK4/6 inhibitors, may be useful depending on the specific genetic makeup or molecular features of the tumor [2].\nImmunotherapy, using drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors, can help boost the immune system to recognize and fight cancer cells [3].\nSupportive care, also known as palliative care, focuses on managing symptoms and improving the quality of life for the patient and may involve pain management, nutritional support, and psychological support [4].\nIt is important to note that the optimal treatment plan for this patient will depend on the specific circumstances and should be decided in consultation with their healthcare team[5].",

    "question": "A case presented, 45 year old female, presents only some mild dyspnea, 4 hour evolution. She has a chest X-ray that was taken yesterday and you identify cardiomegaly. How do you measure the grades for cardiomegaly?",
    "gold": "Cardiomegaly can be measured using the cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) on a chest X-ray, which compares the size of the heart to the width of the chest [1].\nTo calculate the CTR, you measure the maximal horizontal width of the cardiac silhouette (heart) from both sides (A and B) and the maximal horizontal width of the thoracic cavity (chest) at the level of the diaphragm (C), thus the measures are used in the formula A+B/C, important to remember the answer can not be >1\nThe CTR is then computed by dividing the width of the heart by the width of the chest and multiplying the result by 100 to get a percentage [3].\nA CTR of 50% or higher is considered cardiomegaly [4].\nAdditionally, cardiomegaly can be graded as follows :\n\n- Grade 1 (mild): CTR between 50-55%\n- Grade 2 (moderate): CTR between 55-60%\n- Grade 3 (severe): CTR between 60-65%\n-Grade 4: CTR above 65%\n\nIt is important to note that the CTR can vary depending on factors such as the patient's age, gender, and body habitus [5].\nTherefore, while the CTR is a helpful tool to measure cardiomegaly, it should be interpreted within the context of the patient's overall clinical presentation[6].\nFor a more precise assessment of cardiac size and function, additional imaging studies, such as echocardiography, may be needed [7].",

Perhaps something comparing current 5/6 generation dye kits to previous 4/5 dye kits using the same genetic analyzer (eg 3500xL instrument) would more correctly address this question.\nAccording to one source[4], **GlobalFiler™ PCR Amplification Kit** from Applied Biosystems™ is one of the new STR amplification systems with **6-dye chemistry** that displays the highest performance measures among three systems compared.\n\nI think this is a great comparison of a number of new 6 dye kits.  This is a reputable publication and appears to be a solid assessment and comparison.  \nAnother source[5] mentions that **Spectrum CE System** from Promega Corporation is a capillary electrophoresis instrument that supports **8-dye technology** and is suitable for use with **5- and 6-color popular STR amplification kits**.\nHowever, I could not find any direct comparison between the baseline cleanliness of next generation 6 dye and current generation 5 dye kits.",

    "question": "If we apply GnRH to cultured neurons and observe neuritic growth, what would be the possible mechanism of action of this hormone on neurons?",
    "gold": "The possible mechanism of action of GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) on cultured neurons leading to neuritic growth could be attributed to the activation of GnRH receptors and the subsequent signaling pathways involved in neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth  [1].\nGnRH can activate protein kinase C (PKC) , which in turn can phosphorylate several target proteins that are involved in the regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics, leading to neurite outgrowth [2].\nAdditionally, GnRH may also activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways , which play a crucial role in cell survival, differentiation, and neuritic growth [3].\nFurthermore, GnRH-induced activation of intracellular calcium signaling may contribute to neuritic growth by modulating the activity of calcium-dependent enzymes and transcription factors involved in neuronal development [4].",

    "question": "A male with 80 years old presents with chronic cough for the last two years. What should you order to study the patient's condition?",
    "gold": "In a case where an 80-year-old male presents with chronic cough for the last two years, the first steps to evaluate the patient's condition would involve taking a careful history and conducting a thorough physical examination [2].\nWhile no single feature at this stage is likely to determine the diagnosis, it is essential in guiding further investigation or choice of treatment [2].\n Once the history and physical examination have been completed, consider performing spirometry with reversibility testing, which is a diagnostic tool available in most hospitals and an increasing number of primary care clinics [5].\nSpirometry helps assess the patient's lung function and can identify any possible airflow obstruction [5].\n Additionally, diagnostic protocols that follow the \"anatomic diagnostic protocol\" approach, as described by Irwin and colleagues, may be helpful [3].\nThis approach involves using a combination of history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations directed at specific anatomical sites where cough receptors are located [3].\nBy following this protocol, a cause for the cough can be identified in most cases (>90%) [3].\n Keep in mind that chronic cough may be caused by multiple conditions simultaneously, and despite comprehensive evaluation and treatment, up to 20% of patients may remain symptomatic [4].\nHowever, following a thorough evaluation that includes history-taking, physical examination, spirometry, and potentially a diagnostic protocol such as the one proposed by Irwin et al.,\nyou should get a clearer understanding of the patient's chronic cough, leading to appropriate management and treatment options.",

    "question": "What are the differences between Acute myeloid leukemia and Chronic myeloid leukemia?",
    "gold": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are both types of myeloid leukemia affecting the blood and bone marrow, but they differ in their progression, genetic and molecular alterations, clinical presentation, and treatment approaches  [1].\nProgression: AML is characterized by a rapid onset and aggressive progression, with the accumulation of abnormal immature white blood cells called myeloblasts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood [2].\nCML, on the other hand, has a more gradual onset and progresses more slowly, often occurring in three stages – the chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast crisis [3].\nGenetic and molecular alterations: The primary genetic abnormality in most cases of CML is the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, which results from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22  [4].\nAML is associated with a variety of chromosomal aberrations and molecular mutations, such as FLT3, NPM1, and CEBPA mutations, with no single characteristic genetic change  [5].\nClinical presentation: AML tends to present with symptoms related to bone marrow failure, such as fatigue, pallor, bleeding, or fever due to infections [6].\nCML often presents with mild to no symptoms in the early stages, but may later manifest as fatigue, weight loss, and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) [7].\nTreatment approaches: Treatment for AML typically focuses on intensive induction chemotherapy, followed by consolidation therapy with chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, depending on the risk stratification of the patient [8].\nCML treatment primarily involves the use of targeted oral therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib, which specifically targets the BCR-ABL1 protein produced as a result of the Philadelphia chromosome [9].\nIn summary, acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia differ in the speed of their progression, underlying genetic alterations, clinical manifestations, and treatment strategies[10].",
