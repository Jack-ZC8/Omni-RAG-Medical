The focus will be on stretching your Achilles tendon. This can help the bursitis improve and prevent it from coming back.  If these treatments DO NOT work, your provider may inject a small amount of steroid medicine into the bursa. After the injection, you should avoid overstretching the tendon because it can break open (rupture).

    "question": "Question. What is the consensus of medical doctors as to whether asthma can be cured? And do you have an article discussing whether asthma can be cured?",
    "gold": "The goals of treatment are:  - Control airway swelling  - Stay away from substances that trigger your symptoms   - Help you to be able to do normal activities without asthma symptoms   You and your doctor should work as a team to manage your asthma. Follow your doctor's instructions on taking medicines, eliminating asthma triggers, and monitoring symptoms.  MEDICINES FOR ASTHMA   There are two kinds of medicines for treating asthma:  - Control medicines to help prevent attacks  - Quick-relief (rescue) medicines for use during attacks   LONG-TERM MEDICINES  These are also called maintenance or control medicines. They are used to prevent symptoms in people with moderate to severe asthma. You must take them every day for them to work. Take them even when you feel OK.  Some long-term medicines are breathed in (inhaled), such as steroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Others are taken by mouth (orally). Your doctor will prescribe the right medicine for you.  QUICK-RELIEF MEDICINES  These are also called rescue medicines. They are taken:  - For coughing, wheezing, trouble breathing, or an asthma attack  - Just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise   Tell your doctor if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more. If so, your asthma may not be under control and your doctor may need to change your dose of daily control drugs.  Quick-relief medicines include:  - Short-acting inhaled bronchodilators  - Oral corticosteroids for when you have an asthma attack that is not going away   A severe asthma attack requires a checkup by a doctor. You may also need a hospital stay. There, you will likely be given oxygen, breathing assistance, and medicines given through a vein (IV).  ASTHMA CARE AT HOME  - Know the asthma symptoms to watch for.  - Know how to take your peak flow reading and what it means.  - Know which triggers make your asthma worse and what to do when this happens.  - Know how to care for your asthma when you exercise.   Asthma action plans are written documents for managing asthma. An asthma action plan should include:  - Instructions for taking asthma medicines when your condition is stable  - A list of asthma triggers and how to avoid them  - How to recognize when your asthma is getting worse, and when to call your doctor or nurse   A peak flow meter is a simple device to measure how quickly you can move air out of your lungs.  - It can help you see if an attack is coming, sometimes even before symptoms appear. Peak flow measurements help let you know when you need to take medicine or other action.  - Peak flow values of 50 to 80% of your best results are a sign of a moderate asthma attack. Numbers below 50% are a sign of a severe attack.",

    "question": "Need to fix my cross eyed",
    "gold": "Eye muscle repair is surgery to correct eye muscle problems that cause strabismus (crossed eyes).  Description    The goal of this surgery is to restore the eye muscles to a proper position. This will help the eyes move correctly.    Eye muscle surgery is most often done on children. However, adults who have similar eye problems may also have it done. Children will most often have general anesthesia for the procedure. They will be asleep and will not feel pain.    Depending on the problem, one or both eyes may need surgery.    After the anesthesia has taken effect, the eye surgeon makes a small surgical cut in the clear tissue covering the white of the eye. This tissue is called the conjunctiva. Then the surgeon will locate one or more of the eye muscles that needs surgery. Sometimes the surgery strengthens the muscle, and sometimes it weakens it.        To strengthen a muscle, a section of the muscle or tendon may be removed to make it shorter. This step in the surgery is called a resection.      To weaken a muscle, it is reattached to a point farther toward the back of the eye. This step is called a recession.    The surgery for adults is similar. In most cases, adults are awake, but are given medicine to numb the area and help them relax.    When the procedure is done on adults, an adjustable stitch is used on the weakened muscle so that minor changes can be made later that day or the next day. This technique often has a very good outcome.",

Other tips include:  - If you are overweight or obese, in many cases, losing weight can help.  - Avoid drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) to relieve pain.  - Take all of your medicines with plenty of water. When your doctor gives you a new medicine, ask whether it will make your heartburn worse.    You may use over-the-counter antacids after meals and at bedtime, although the relief may not last very long. Common side effects of antacids include diarrhea or constipation.  Other over-the-counter and prescription drugs can treat GERD. They work more slowly than antacids, but give you longer relief. Your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse can tell you how to take these drugs.  - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) decrease the amount of acid produced in your stomach  - H2 blockers also lower the amount of acid released in the stomach    Anti-reflux surgery may be an option for people whose symptoms do not go away with lifestyle changes and medicines. Heartburn and other symptoms should improve after surgery. But you may still need to take drugs for your heartburn.

He or she can help to determine what is causing your dry mouth. If your dry mouth is caused by medicine, your physician might change your medicine or adjust the dosage. If your salivary glands are not working right but can still produce some saliva, your dentist or physician might give you a medicine that helps the glands work better. Your dentist or physician might also suggest that you use artificial saliva to keep your mouth wet. Do's and Don'ts Do's - Do drink water or sugarless drinks often. That will make chewing and swallowing easier when eating.  - Do chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless hard candy to stimulate saliva flow.  - Do use a humidifier at night to promote moisture in the air while you sleep.

Don't use tobacco or alcohol. They dry out the mouth. Gene Therapy Research for Salivary Gland Dysfunction Scientists at NIH’s National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) are exploring the potential use of gene therapy to treat salivary gland dysfunction. The idea is to transfer additional or replacement genes into the salivary glands of people with Sjögren's syndrome and cancer patients whose salivary glands were damaged during radiation treatment. The hope is that these genes will increase the production of saliva and eliminate the chronic parched sensation that bothers people with dry mouth conditions. NIDCR recently completed a clinical study, a research study in humans, on gene therapy for radiation-damaged salivary glands. The study showed that gene therapy can be safely performed in salivary glands and that it has the potential to help head and neck cancer survivors with dry mouth. Read NIDCR’s news release  to learn more about the study’s findings. Based on the promising results of this trial, similar clinical trials are planned in the near future. Research on Sjögren’s Syndrome and Other Diseases Affecting Salivary Glands NIDCR is also conducting clinical trials to study new approaches for improving salivary flow in patients with Sjogren’s syndrome. Such studies include testing the effectiveness of a monoclonal antibody as well as a corticosteroid to see whether either of these treatments helps improve salivary flow. Other studies are focused on learning how diseases such as diabetes, auto inflammatory diseases, and granulomatous diseases cause salivary gland dysfunction. Such studies could one day lead to better ways of preventing and treating salivary gland conditions. To stay abreast of any new studies on gene therapy and salivary gland function, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.  ClinicalTrials.gov lists all federally and many privately funded clinical trials in the U.S. and around the world; the web site is updated frequently.",

    "gold": "SELF-CARE    Steps you can take to help your acne:        Clean your skin gently with a mild, nondrying soap (such as Dove, Neutrogena, Cetaphil, CeraVe, or Basics).      Look for water-based or \"noncomedogenic\" formulas for cosmetics and skin creams. (Noncomedogenic products have been tested and proven not to clog pores and cause acne.)      Remove all dirt or make-up. Wash once or twice a day, including after exercising.      Avoid scrubbing or repeated skin washing.      Shampoo your hair daily, especially if it is oily.      Comb or pull your hair back to keep the hair out of your face.     What NOT to do:        Try not to squeeze, scratch, pick, or rub the pimples. This can lead to skin infections and scarring.      Avoid wearing tight headbands, baseball caps, and other hats.      Avoid touching your face with your hands or fingers.      Avoid greasy cosmetics or creams.      DO NOT leave make-up on overnight.     If these steps do not clear up the blemishes, try over-the-counter acne medicines that you apply to your skin.        These products may contain benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid.      They work by killing bacteria, drying up skin oils, or causing the top layer of your skin to peel.      They may cause redness, drying, or peeling of the skin.     A small amount of sun exposure may improve acne slightly, but tanning mostly hides the acne. Too much exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet rays is not recommended because it increases the risk for skin cancer.    MEDICINES FROM YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER    If pimples are still a problem, a provider can prescribe stronger medicines and discuss other options with you.    Antibiotics may help some people with acne:        Oral antibiotics (taken by mouth) such as tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, erythromycin, trimethoprim, and amoxicillin      Topical antibiotics (applied to the skin) such as clindamycin, erythromycin, or dapsone     Creams or gels applied to the skin may be prescribed:        Retinoic acid cream or gel (tretinoin, Retin-A)      Prescription formulas of benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid      Topical azelaic acid     For women whose acne is caused or made worse by hormones:        A pill called spironolactone may help.      Birth control pills may help in some cases, though they may make acne worse in some women.     Minor procedures or treatments may also be helpful:        A laser procedure called photodynamic therapy may be used.      Your provider may also suggest chemical skin peeling; removal of scars by dermabrasion; or removal, drainage, or injection of cysts with cortisone.     People who have cystic acne and scarring may try a medicine called isotretinoin (Accutane). You will be watched closely when taking this medicine because of its side effects.    Pregnant women should NOT take Accutane, because it causes severe birth defects.        Women taking Accutane must use 2 forms of birth control before starting the drug and enroll in the iPledge program.      Men also need to be enrolled in the iPledge program.

Color vision is typically not affected by this disorder. The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time. Researchers have identified two major types of X-linked congenital stationary night blindness: the complete form and the incomplete form. The types have very similar signs and symptoms. However, everyone with the complete form has night blindness, while not all people with the incomplete form have night blindness.

Many people gain and lose some weight during any year. Loss of 10 pounds OR 5% of your normal body weight over 6-12 months or less, and you don't know the reason.   This problem may also be called unintentional weight loss.    Causes  A loss of appetite may be due to:  •Feeling depressed •Cancer, even when other symptoms are not present •Chronic infection such as AIDS •Chronic illness, such as COPD or Parkinson disease •Drugs, including chemotherapy drugs, and thyroid medications •Drug abuse such as amphetamines and cocaine •Stress or anxiety  Chronic digestive system problems that decrease the amount of calories and nutrients your body absorbs, including: •Diarrhea and other infections that last a long time, such as parasites •Chronic swelling or infection in the pancreas •Removal of part of the small intestine •Overuse of laxatives  Other causes such as: •Eating disorders, anorexia nervosa that have not been diagnosed yet •Diabetes that have not been diagnosed •Overactive thyroid gland   Home Care  Your healthcare provider may suggest changes in your diet and exercise program depending on the cause of your weight loss.",

    "gold": "Cancers generally are caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. With skin cancer, the environment plays a greater role, but individuals can be born with a genetic disposition toward or vulnerability to getting cancer. The risk is greatest for people who have light-colored skin that freckles easily - often those who also have red or blond hair and blue or light-colored eyes - although anyone can get skin cancer.  Skin cancer is related to lifetime exposure to UV radiation, therefore most skin cancers appear after age 50. However, the sun's damaging effects begin at an early age. People who live in areas that get high levels of UV radiation from the sun are more likely to get skin cancer. For example, the highest rates of skin cancer are found in South Africa and Australia, areas that receive high amounts of UV radiation.  About 10 percent of all patients with melanoma have family members who also have had the disease. Research suggests that a mutation in the CDKN2 gene on chromosome 9 plays a role in this form of melanoma. Studies have also implicated genes on chromosomes 1 and 12 in cases of familial melanoma.",

    "gold": "Guanfacine tablets (Tenex) are used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Guanfacine extended-release (long-acting) tablets (Intuniv) are used as part of a treatment program to control symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; more difficulty focusing, controlling actions, and remaining still or quiet than other people who are the same age) in children. Guanfacine is in a class of medications called centrally acting alpha2A-adrenergic receptor agonists. Guanfacine treats high blood pressure by decreasing heart rate and relaxing the blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily through the body. Guanfacine extended-release tablets may treat ADHD by affecting the part of the brain that controls attention and impulsivity.  High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.",

    "gold": "The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of copper in the tissues. This is done by a procedure called chelation -- certain medications can bind to copper and help remove it through the kidneys or gut. Treatment must be lifelong.  The following medications may be used:  - Penicillamine (Cuprimine, Depen) binds to copper and leads to increased release of copper in the urine.  - Trientine (Syprine) binds (chelates) the copper and increases its release through the urine.  - Zinc acetate (Galzin) blocks copper from being absorbed in the intestinal tract.    Vitamin E supplements may also be used.  Sometimes, medications that chelate copper (especially penicillamine) can affect the function of the brain and nervous system (neurological function). Other medications under investigation may bind copper without affecting neurological function.  A low-copper diet may also be recommended. Foods to avoid include:  - Chocolate  - Dried fruit  - Liver  - Mushrooms  - Nuts  - Shellfish    You may want to drink distilled water because most tap water flows through copper pipes. Avoid using copper cooking utensils.  Symptoms may be treated with exercise or physical therapy. People who are confused or unable to care for themselves may need special protective measures.

Extended spectrum beta-lactamases are produced by most S marcescens strains.[35] International data on antimicrobial susceptibility of Serratia and other nosocomial isolates have been published.[36, 37]  Serratia infections should be treated with an aminoglycoside plus an antipseudomonal beta-lactam, as the single use of a beta-lactam can select for resistant strains. Most strains are susceptible to amikacin, but reports indicate increasing resistance to gentamicin and tobramycin. Quinolones also are highly active against most strains.

Patients with multiple papillomas do have an increased risk of developing cancer and should be kept under annual review with regular mammography (preferably digital mammography) if treated conservatively. Magnetic resonance (MR) can be also used in surveillance in view of its high sensitivity.

    "gold": "DETERMINING THE NEED FOR SURGICAL INTERVENTION  A patient with a stage III or IV ulcer that has not responded to conservative medical treatment may be evaluated for operative repair. Prior to surgery the patient should be in an optimal state both mentally and physically, and factors that impair healing should be minimized. The patient’s ability to tolerate the surgery and participate in the postoperative rehabilitation must be assessed prior to any surgery. Some patients may not be surgical candidates due to malnutrition, immobility, poor compliance with treatment, or chronic diseases.  Operative procedures may include skin grafts or flaps (surgical reconstruction). Which option is available may be limited due to previous surgeries, a shortage of available tissue to use, and impaired blood supply. Immediately after surgery, the operated region must be totally offloaded. Once the surgical incision has healed, the patient will be allowed to gradually apply pressure to the area.  Rates of surgical complications and recurrence rates are high. Complication rates have been reported as high as 49%. Osteomyelitis is the major cause of breakdown after surgery (WOCN, 2010).",

    "question": "How helpful is radiation for melanoma of heel and spread all the way up the leg? Would this effect treatment of trial drugs or other treatments?",
    "gold": "EXTERNAL BEAM RADIATION THERAPY External beam radiation therapy may be used to treat skin cancer itself or to relieve pain from cancer that has spread. Radiation oncologists deliver external beam radiation therapy to the cancer from a machine outside your body. Doctors target the radiation beams at your tumor, giving more radiation to the skin cancer while keeping it away from underlying organs. Skin cancer is often treated with superfi cial forms of radiation. That means the radiation penetrates only a short distance below the surface. Treatment may be given with X-rays or electrons. Treatments are usually scheduled every day, Monday through Friday, for several weeks to accurately deliver radiation to the cancer. Treatments are painless and take less than half an hour each, start to fi nish. Your treatment schedule will depend on your cancer, but it usually requires daily treatments for one or more weeks. Radiation therapy can be given on its own or may also be given in addition to surgery, chemotherapy or biologic therapy. UNDERSTANDING RADIATION THERAPY Radiation therapy, also called radiotherapy, is the careful use of radiation to treat many diff erent kinds of cancer.  Cancer doctors, called radiation oncologists, use radiation therapy to try to cure cancer, to control cancer growth or to relieve symptoms such as pain.  Radiation therapy works within cancer cells by damaging their ability to multiply. When these cells die, the body naturally eliminates them.  Healthy cells that grow and divide quickly are also harmed by radiation, but they are able to repair themselves in a way that cancer cells cannot.  Most radiation is given with an external beam, but treatment can be given with a radioactive source close to the skin with a treatment called brachytherapy, meaning ‘short-distance’ treatment. POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS The side eff ects you might feel will depend on the part of your body being treated, the dose of radiation given and whether you also receive other treatments like chemotherapy. Before treatment begins, ask your doctor about possible side eff ects and how you can best manage them. Nearly all patients will experience redness and moistness of the skin, similar to a brisk sunburn. After treatment ends, the skin will form a protective scab and the new, healthy skin will develop underneath it. This healing may take several months. You will also likely lose your hair in the area treated. Your hair may grow back, but it might not have the same texture or thickness. Talk to your doctor or nurse about any discomfort you feel. He or she may be able to provide medications or other treatments to help.",

Its effect is opposite to that of insulin, which lowers the extracellular glucose.[4]\nThe pancreas releases glucagon when the concentration of insulin (and indirectly glucose) in the bloodstream falls too low. Glucagon causes the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is released into the bloodstream.[5] High blood-glucose levels, on the other hand, stimulate the release of insulin. Insulin allows glucose to be taken up and used by insulin-dependent tissues. Thus, glucagon and insulin are part of a feedback system that keeps blood glucose levels stable. Glucagon increases energy expenditure and is elevated under conditions of stress.[6] Glucagon belongs to the secretin family of hormones.",

During this process, one event triggers another, which triggers another, and so on, to keep your blood sugar levels balanced.\n\nHow insulin works\nDuring digestion, foods that contain carbohydrates are converted into glucose. Most of this glucose is sent into your bloodstream, causing a rise in blood glucose levels. This increase in blood glucose signals your pancreas to produce insulin.\n\nThe insulin tells cells throughout your body to take in glucose from your bloodstream. As the glucose moves into your cells, your blood glucose levels go down. Some cells use the glucose as energy. Other cells, such as in your liver and muscles, store any excess glucose as a substance called glycogen. Your body uses glycogen for fuel between meals.\n\n||\n\nHow glucagon works\nGlucagon works to counterbalance the actions of insulin.\n\nAbout four to six hours after you eat, the glucose levels in your blood decrease, triggering your pancreas to produce glucagon. This hormone signals your liver and muscle cells to change the stored glycogen back into glucose. These cells then release the glucose into your bloodstream so your other cells can use it for energy.\n\nThis whole feedback loop with insulin and glucagon is constantly in motion. It keeps your blood sugar levels from dipping too low, ensuring that your body has a steady supply of energy.",

    "gold": "Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4: Lovastatin, like several other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, is a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Certain drugs which inhibit this metabolic pathway can raise the plasma levels of lovastatin and may increase the risk of myopathy. These include itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, the macrolide antibiotics erythromycin and clarithromycin, the ketolide antibiotic telithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, boceprevir, telaprevir, the antidepressant nefazodone, or cobicistat-containing products. Combination of these drugs with lovastatin is contraindicated. If short-term treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is unavoidable, therapy with lovastatin should be suspended during the course of treatment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS; PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS).\n\nGemfibrozil: The combined use of lovastatin with gemfibrozil should be avoided.\n\nOther lipid-lowering drugs (other fibrates or greater than or equal to 1 g/day of niacin): Caution should be used when prescribing other fibrates or lipid-lowering doses (greater than or equal to 1 g/day) of niacin with lovastatin, as these agents can cause myopathy when given alone. The benefit of further alterations in lipid levels by the combined use of lovastatin with other fibrates or niacin should be carefully weighed against the potential risks of these combinations.",

    "gold": "The following are key points to remember about the updated guideline on duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD):\n\nThe scope of this focused update is limited to addressing recommendations on duration of DAPT (aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).\nIntensification of antiplatelet therapy, with the addition of a P2Y12 inhibitor to aspirin monotherapy, and prolongation of DAPT, necessitate a fundamental tradeoff between decreasing ischemic risk and increasing bleeding risk. Decisions regarding treatment with and duration of DAPT require a thoughtful assessment of the benefit/risk ratio, integration of study data, and patient preference.\nRecommendations in the document apply specifically to duration of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy in patients with CAD treated with DAPT. Aspirin therapy should almost always be continued indefinitely in patients with CAD.\nLower daily doses of aspirin, including in patients treated with DAPT, are associated with lower bleeding complications and comparable ischemic protection compared with higher doses of aspirin. The recommended daily dose of aspirin in patients treated with DAPT is 81 mg (range 75–100 mg).\nIn patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) treated with DAPT after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy with clopidogrel should be given for at least 6 months (Class I). In patients with SIHD treated with DAPT after bare-metal stent (BMS) implantation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (clopidogrel) should be given for a minimum of 1 month (Class I).\nIn patients with SIHD treated with DAPT after BMS or DES implantation who have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding complication and who are not at high bleeding risk (e.g., prior bleeding on DAPT, coagulopathy, oral anticoagulant use), continuation of DAPT with clopidogrel for longer than 1 month in patients treated with BMS or longer than 6 months in patients treated with DES may be reasonable (Class IIb).\nIn patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (non-ST elevation [NSTE]-ACS or ST elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]) treated with DAPT after BMS or DES implantation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) should be given for at least 12 months (Class I).\nIn patients with ACS (NSTE-ACS or STEMI) treated with coronary stent implantation who have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding complication and who are not at high bleeding risk (e.g., prior bleeding on DAPT, coagulopathy, oral anticoagulant use), continuation of DAPT (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) for longer than 12 months may be reasonable (Class IIb). A new risk score (the “DAPT score”), derived from the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy study, may be useful for decisions about whether to continue (prolong or extend) DAPT in patients treated with coronary stent implantation.\nIn patients with ACS (NSTE-ACS or STEMI) treated with DAPT after coronary stent implantation and in patients with NSTE-ACS treated with medical therapy alone (without revascularization), it is reasonable to use ticagrelor in preference to clopidogrel for maintenance P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (Class IIa). Among those who are not at high risk for bleeding complications and who do not have a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, it is reasonable to choose prasugrel over clopidogrel for maintenance P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (Class IIa).\nIn patients with ACS (NSTE-ACS or STEMI) being treated with DAPT who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), P2Y12 inhibitor therapy should be resumed after CABG to complete 12 months of DAPT therapy after ACS (Class I).\nIn patients with STEMI treated with DAPT in conjunction with fibrinolytic therapy, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (clopidogrel) should be continued for a minimum of 14 days and ideally at least 12 months (Class I).\nElective noncardiac surgery should be delayed 30 days after BMS implantation and optimally 6 months after DES implantation. In patients treated with DAPT after coronary stent implantation who must undergo surgical procedures that mandate the discontinuation of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy, it is recommended that aspirin be continued if possible and the P2Y12 platelet receptor inhibitor be restarted as soon as possible after surgery (Class I).",

    "gold": "The potential causes of bite problems and jaw pain after orthodontic treatment could be due to malocclusion, an improperly aligned jaw, or residual issues from the initial treatment process [1] [4].\nMalocclusion can cause pressure points between opposing teeth when chewing or talking, leading to pain, sensitivity, or chipping [1].\nAn improperly aligned jaw can also cause discomfort around the jawline [1].\n Non-surgical options for addressing these issues include bite correction through orthodontic treatment, such as traditional metal braces or clear aligner trays [5].\nThese appliances can be fitted to the teeth and apply pressure to gradually move them into a more appropriate position, correcting upper and lower jaw alignments [5].\nAnother non-surgical option could be using headgear, which is particularly useful in cases where the patient's jaw and facial bones are still growing [3].\nThese alignment tools can help adjust the position of the teeth and jaws as the facial structure develops [3].\nIt is essential for the patient to consult with an orthodontist, who is a specialist in treating difficult issues, to determine the most suitable course of action for their specific situation [2] [4].",

    "gold": "To understand the mind of a politician while they are giving a speech, it is essential to be aware of the techniques they employ to appeal to their audience and persuade them.\nOne such technique is the \"great speech game,\" wherein politicians tailor their speech to tell the audience exactly what they want to hear, playing on their emotions [2].\nSome politicians are gifted speakers but may not necessarily be effective when it comes to getting the job done [1].\nIt is crucial not to equate great speeches with performance and to examine politicians' track records in and out of government [1].\n Another psychological aspect to consider is how politicians manipulate short-term memory [1].\nThey may use techniques such as providing food, money, or entertainment at rallies to create a temporary positive experience that distracts from past performance issues [2].\nThese tactics can deceive the audience into believing the politician is more competent and aligned with their needs than they might be in reality.\n In summary, understanding the mind of a politician during their speech involves recognizing their use of persuasive techniques, emotional appeals, and manipulation of short-term memory to win support.\nEvaluating their past performance, actions, and credibility helps in forming a more accurate understanding of the politician's intentions [1] [2].",

    "question": "Is it possible to compound intrathecal methotrexat?",
    "gold": "Yes, it is possible to compound intrathecal methotrexate [1].\nIntrathecal methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug that can be administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during a lumbar puncture [2].  Type of procedures used Intrathecal chemotherapy can be given in two ways: Lumbar puncture. A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is a way to access your spine and deliver the medication to your CSF.\nThe compounding of intrathecal methotrexate should be done in a sterile environment, such as a cleanroom, using proper aseptic techniques to ensure safe and appropriate medication administration to the patient [3]. Compounding of sterile doses of HDs should be done in a facility that meets USP <797> and USP <800> (USP 797, 2012; USP 800, 2016).\nThis is important in order to minimize the risk of contamination, which can lead to severe complications, such as meningitis or other infections [4]. When you need to cough or sneeze, be sure to cover your mouth and nose. If you're pregnant, take care with food. Reduce your risk of a listeria infection by cooking meat, including hot dogs and deli meat, to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius). Avoid cheeses made from unpasteurized milk. Choose cheeses that are clearly labeled as being made with pasteurized milk.",
